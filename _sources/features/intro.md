# Quantum Mechanics with QuTiP

Welcome! This book is designed to be an introduction to QuTiP for anyone that is relatively new to numerical quantum mechanics (or new to quantum mechanics in general). This isn't a complete guide to the subject, but we aim to provide enough context to help you bridge a conceptual and theoretical foundation to a numerical/computational understanding of quantum mechanics.

This is very much a work in progress, and there are a lot of rough edges. We try to maintain examples so they run with current versions of relevant software. Usually this means the latest release of QuTiP (4.5.1 at this last update).

As they are made available, book chapters will be listed here. Please stay tuned for updates.
