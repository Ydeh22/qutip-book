# QuTiP Book
Authors:
Andrew M.C. Dawes (dawes@pacificu.edu) github.com/amcdawes

**Mission:** This book is designed to be an introduction to QuTiP for anyone that is relatively new to numerical quantum mechanics (or to quantum mechanics in general). This isnâ€™t a complete guide to the subject, but we aim to provide enough context to help you bridge a conceptual and theoretical foundation to a numerical/computational understanding of quantum mechanics.

**Structure:** The QuTiP book uses Jupyter-book to package **ipynb** notebook files and present them in a navigable online format. Each chapter is contained in a single file, and will be tested against stable QuTiP versions. See below for content guidelines.

**Governance:** Project administrators are members of the steering committee and will include at least one person from the QuTiP Admin Team in order to facilitate communication within the QuTiP project. Contributions are welcome from anyone and will be accepted through the GitHub PR process by steering committee members who will have owner rights to the GitHub repository.

**Content Guidelines:** The steering committee will guide content decisions and provide feedback to contributors. In general, if a topic is not currently included in the book, a chapter should be created and submitted. The steering committee will work to place submitted chapters in an appropriate sequence.

For additions to the book, the following priorities should be observed:



 1. Technical Correctness
    - Both quantum mechanical theory and qutip code should be correct and working
 2. Accessibility
    - Assume a reader starting out with this book is not familiar with undergraduate quantum mechanics, but has experience with calculus, linear algebra, and some modern physics topics.
    - Advanced topics can be included if the concepts required to understand them are available in earlier chapters.
 3. Concise
    - Rely on and refer to earlier content when adding new topics. Each chapter need not be self-contained, but should link to appropriate background information whenever possible.
