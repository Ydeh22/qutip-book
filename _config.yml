title: Quantum Mechanics with QuTiP
author: Andrew M.C. Dawes
email: dawes@pacificu.edu
description: >-
  An introduction to QuTiP in the context of quantum mechanics. While not a complete
  textbook, this book is designed to merge numerical techniques available with QuTiP
  into a course on quantum mechanics. The content is not tied to a particular textbook
  but flows well with books that begin from a spin-system perspective.
