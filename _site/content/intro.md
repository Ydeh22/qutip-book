# Quantum Mechanics with QuTiP

## Introduction

This book serves as an introduction to QuTiP and a reference to be used in conjunction with a typical course on quantum mechanics. Where possible, we have indicated overlap with particular chapters of specific textbooks. Hopefully, an early feature will be the ability to select versions of this based on specific texts, although that may not be realistic to implement completely.

## Note to instructors

We suggest that you browse this book as a supplement to your courses and pull examples, notebooks, calculations etc. that serve to reinforce the concepts you introduce. This is not a standalone reference for learning quantum mechanics, but it is intended to fit into a variety of courses (undergraduate or graduate) and serve as a reference for anyone getting started with QuTiP.

Thank you to the developers of QuTiP and the many contributors who continue to maintain the package.
